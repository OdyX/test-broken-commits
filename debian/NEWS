cupsys (1.2.11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The cupsd server process now runs as a system user 'cupsys' instead of
    root. This limits the potential impact of any vulnerability in cupsd or
    one of its callouts to the printing configuration and jobs instead of
    offering a wide open vector for root compromise. This change and the
    upgrade should be transparent, thus this does not require any
    configuration change.
  * The groups of the cupsys system user ensures that cupsd can open parallel
    and USB printer devices (lp), serial printers (dialout), and
    printer/scanner combinations (scanner). For out-of-the box usage of the
    Snakeoil SSL certificate it is also in the ssl-cert group.
  * This version breaks the current cups-pdf package. A new version of
    cups-pdf is prepared and will be uploaded soon.

cupsys (1.2.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * The USB backend no longer supports the usb:/dev/foo
    format on systems that support device ID queries since 1.2.1-1.
    Because Linux supports device ID queries, you have to
    replace your printer configuration uses usb:/dev/foo style
    with device ID style. usb backend will show device IDs of
    active USB printers.
  * Port/Listen and Browsing parameters are merged again to
    /etc/cups/cupsd.conf. Therefore debconf configuration interface
    for them is removed. For your information, CUPS Web interface
    (http://localhost:631) provides a server configuration interface.

cupsys (1.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 1.2.1.
    This is major version up of CUPS and has several changes from
    1.1 series.
    Although CUPS 1.2 provides a backward compatibility, your
    old configuration won't work in some cases.
  * 'enable' / 'disable' commands are removed. Use 'cupsenable' /
    'cupsdisable'.
  * Port/Listen and Browsing parameters have been split off of
    /etc/cups/cupsd.conf into separate files. You can modify
    /etc/cups/cups.d/ports.conf and
    /etc/cups/cups.d/browsing.conf by runing
    'dpkg-reconfigure cupsys' or by hand.
    If you'd like to use these features, then replace the lines
    'Port/Listen' inside /etc/cups/cupsd.conf with
    'Include /etc/cups/cups.d/ports.conf' and 'Browsing' with
    'Include /etc/cups/cups.d/browse.conf'.
    (These settings are being moved automatically from the old
     /etc/cups/cupsd.conf config file to the new files
     /etc/cups/cups.d/ports.conf and /etc/cups/cups.d/browse.conf)
