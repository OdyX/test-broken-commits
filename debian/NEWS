cupsys (1.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 1.2.1.
    This is major version up of CUPS and has several changes from
    1.1 series.
    Although CUPS 1.2 provides a backward compatibility, your
    old configuration won't work in some cases.
  * 'enable' / 'disable' commands are removed. Use 'cupsenable' /
    'cupsdisable'.
  * Ports/Listen and Browsing parameters are splitted from main
    /etc/cups/cupsd.conf. You can modify /etc/cups/cups.d/ports.conf
    and /etc/cups/cups.d/browsing.conf by 'dpkg-reconfigure cupsys'
    or by hand.
