cupsys (1.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 1.2.1.
    This is major version up of CUPS and has several changes from
    1.1 series.
    Although CUPS 1.2 provides a backward compatibility, your
    old configuration won't work in some cases.
  * 'enable' / 'disable' commands are removed. Use 'cupsenable' /
    'cupsdisable'.
  * Port/Listen and Browsing parameters are splitted from newer
    /etc/cups/cupsd.conf. You can modify /etc/cups/cups.d/ports.conf
    and /etc/cups/cups.d/browsing.conf by 'dpkg-reconfigure cupsys'
    or by hand.
    If you'd like to use this feature, replace Port/Listen
    line of /etc/cups/cupsd.conf with
    'Include /etc/cups/cups.d/ports.conf' and replace Browsing line
    with 'Include /etc/cups/cups.d/browse.conf'.
    (Parameters are already taken from old /etc/cups/cupsd.conf
     automatically.)
