cupsys (1.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 1.2.1.
    This is major version up of CUPS and has several changes from
    1.1 series.
    Although CUPS 1.2 provides a backward compatibility, your
    old configuration won't work in some cases.
  * 'enable' / 'disable' commands are removed. Use 'cupsenable' /
    'cupsdisable'.
  * Port/Listen and Browsing parameters have been split off of
    /etc/cups/cupsd.conf into separate files. You can modify
    /etc/cups/cups.d/ports.conf and
    /etc/cups/cups.d/browsing.conf by runing
    'dpkg-reconfigure cupsys' or by hand.
    If you'd like to use these features, then replace the lines
    'Port/Listen' inside /etc/cups/cupsd.conf with
    'Include /etc/cups/cups.d/ports.conf' and 'Browsing' with
    'Include /etc/cups/cups.d/browse.conf'.
    (These settings are being moved automatically from the old
     /etc/cups/cupsd.conf config file to the new files
     /etc/cups/cups.d/ports.conf and /etc/cups/cups.d/browse.conf)
