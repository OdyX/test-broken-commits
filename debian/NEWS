cupsys (1.1.99.rc2-0exp1) experimental; urgency=low

  * This is EXPERIMENTAL version.
    - By ABI incompatibility, KDE control center will complain.
  * 'enable' and 'disable' commands are removed.
    Use 'cupsenable' and 'cupsdisable' instead of them.
  * /etc/cups/client.conf has been removed upstream. Now it becomes
    obsolete.
