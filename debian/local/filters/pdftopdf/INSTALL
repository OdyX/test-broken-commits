1. HOW TO BUILD AND INSTALL PDFTOPDF

"pdftopdf" depends on cups and poppler library. Install these libraries
before building and installing "pdftopdf".
And follow the step below;

$ autoreconf --install
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc
$ make
$ su -c "make install"


NOTE:
Some Linux distributions (ex. Fedora 7) don't install poppler headers
needed to build "pdftopdf".
In such case, you have to download the poppler source tree which is appropriate
for your system. 

After downloading and extracting the poppler source tree, change the current
directory to <popplersrc> where the top directory of poppler source tree is
 <popplersrc>, and follow the step below;

$ ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc

After making the build configuration, change the current directory to the
top directory of "pdftopdf" source tree, and follow the steps below;
(<popplersrc> must be the full path)

$ autoreconf --install
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --with-poppler-source=<popplersrc>
$ make
$ su -c "make install"
