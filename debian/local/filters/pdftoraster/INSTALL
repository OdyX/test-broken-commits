1. HOW TO BUILD AND INSTALL PDFTORASTER

"pdftoraster" depends on cups and poppler library. Install these libraries
before building and installing "pdftoraster".
And follow the step below;

$ autoreconf --install
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc
$ make
$ su -c "make install"

Note:
  This program requires CUPS version 1.2 or higher. If the CUPS version on
  your system is older than 1.2, before running configure command, download
  the CUPS source tree which version is 1.2 or higher, and extract and build
  it. Then, add "--with-cups-build=<cupsbuild>" option when running
  the configure command.

Note:
Some Linux distributions (ex. Fedora 7) don't install poppler headers
needed to build "pdftoraster".
In such case, you have to download the poppler source tree which is appropriate
for your system.

After downloading and extracting the poppler source tree, change the current
directory to <popplersrc> where the top directory of poppler source tree is
 <popplersrc>, and follow the step below;

 $ ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc

 After making the build configuration, change the current directory to the
 top directory of "pdftoraster" source tree, and follow the steps below;
 (<popplersrc> must be the full path)

 $ autoreconf --install
 $ ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --with-poppler-source=<popplersrc>
 $ make
 $ su -c "make install"


2. INSTALLED FILES

"pdftoraster" works as a CUPS filter, and is installed into the CUPS filters
directory. "cups-config" command helps you know the CUPS server binary
directory that CUPS filters are installed in, and CUPS server root directory
that CUPS configuration files are installed in.

Installed files are as follows;

(1) pdftoraster
CUPS PDF filter which converts a PDF file or data stream given by upper
CUPS filters or applications to CUPS raster. This program is installed into
the "filter" directory under the CUPS server binary directory. 

(2) pdftoraster.convs
Filter definition file for "pdftoraster" filter.
This file is installed into the CUPS server root directory.
