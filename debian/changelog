cupsys (1.2.1-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  [Kenshi Muto]
  * Include changelogs during 1.1.23-13 - 1.1.23-15. (closes: #374494)
  * Apply upstream svn change r5754.
    - Fix negotiation problem between unstable clients and sarge servers.
      (closes: #375359)
  * 58_fixdestc: avoid build failure of r5754 (add ipp-private.h include).
  * 59_de_docroot: install German translation/images. Although upstream
    SVN has, Debian diff structure can't handle a binary diff. This patch
    will be removed when 1.2.2 is released.
  * Add snmp to backend choices. Because I don't make sure this backend
    is stable, the default is disabled. Use dpkg-reconfigure cupsys to
    enable. (closes: #376496)
  * Don't remove backend symlinks during reconfigure/upgrade process.
    (closes: #376499)
  * Check Include directive with case insensitive. (closes: #376883)
  * libcupsys2 has /etc/cups directory to allow admin put own
    client.conf. (closes: #370788)
  * Include sample client.conf in libcupsys2. You can copy /usr/share/
    doc/libcupsys2/examples/client.conf to /etc/cups or ~/.cups and modify
    for your environment. (closes: #376840)
  * Split locale files to new package "cupsys-common". (closes: #378659)
    This package is used by cupsys and cupsys-client/cupsys-bsd.
  * removed 26_modprobe: because parallel backend executes with user 'lp'
    permission, modprobe can't work. We CUPS team believe it's better 
    that lp module is loaded by discover or any other hardware detection
    programs instead of CUPS. We provide a module loader by init script
    for user's convenience at this time.
  * 60_device_uri: preserve old URI during the printer configuration on
    Web interface.

  * Improve the wording of NEWS file, thanks Tomas (closes: #372256)
  * 53_usr_share_ppd_support: Use /usr/share/ppd as PPD path.
    (closes: #365300, #373722)
    Make symlink /usr/share/ppd/cups-transitional-dir -> /usr/share/cups/ppd
    for keeping a compatibility. We'll migrate all of PPD files to
    /usr/share/ppd in the future.
  * Revert to use single /etc/cups/cupsd.conf file for the configuration
    instead of using separate files in /etc/cups/cups.d. The migration will
    be done automatically. (closes: #345973, #372727)
  * Apply correct permission modes to the files under /etc/cups at postinst
    stage.
  * Update debconf translations:
    - Danish (closes: #371170)

  * Update Italian debconf translation (closes: #367943)
  * Includes the installation guide of dvi filter to /usr/share/doc/
    cupsys/examples/filters/dvipipetops.INSTALL is contributed by
    Francesco Potort. This is partial fix for Bug#368450.

  [Martin Pitt]
  * New upstream release 1.2.0.
  * Update patches for new upstream release.
  * Remove debian/patches/01_cupsimage.dpatch, fixed upstream.
  * Remove debian/patches/20_httpGetHostname_crash.dpatch, fixed upstream.
  * debian/patches/55_ppd_okidata_name.dpatch: Change "Oki" manufacturer name
    to "Okidata" to be consistent with other PPD files.
  * Implement http://wiki.debian.org/PpdFileStructureSpecification:
    - debian/dirs: Create /usr/share/ppd/cups-included/.
    - debian/rules: Install shipped PPDs into
      /usr/share/ppd/cups-included/<Manufacturer>/ and provide a symlink to
      the old /usr/share/cups/model directory for backwards compatibility.
  * debian/cupsys.dirs: Ship /usr/lib/cups/driver/ to avoid error messages if
    it's missing.
  * debian/patches/09_runasuser.dpatch, scheduler/cert.c: Change root
    certificate permissions from 0440 to 0240, so that the CGI programs cannot
    read it any more. Without this patch, cupsd presented its own certificate
    to itself, and *every* user could do admin tasks without authentication.
  * debian/cupsys-client.links: Fix cupsenable/cupsdisable manpage link.
    Closes: #364447
  * debian/patches/08_cupsd.conf.conf.d.dpatch:
    - Set "BrowseAddress @LOCAL"; without this, sending browsing information
      does not work (Browsing still has to be enabled).
    - Add some comments to point out that the Port and Browsing settings are
      moved to /etc/cups/cups.d/.
  * debian/cupsys.postrm: Clean up passwd.md5 on purge.

cupsys (1.1.99.rc2-0exp1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Kenshi Muto ]
  * New upstream release 1.2RC2.
    - Because -fpie config becomes optional, compiler works on amd64 and
      other architectures. (closes: #335199)
  * Enable LDAP support.
  * Remove duplicated update-rc.d (closes: #356911)
  * Stopped asking admin password because it works only if user chooses
    digest authentication. The default configuration of Debian uses
    PAM and basic authentication.
  * Enable dbus support.
  * 03_clean.dpatch: Remove produced and remained files during build.
  * Now CUPS uses 'lp' user/group privilege to call backend or any other
    programs.
    CUPS SystemGroup is 'lpadmin'. You need to add users who are allowed
    to add/modify/remove printers/jobs/classes.
  * Remove image.h.patch from source. It is no longer needed.
  * 02_configure.dpath: Remove -rpath from configure.
  * Fix typo in cupsys-bsd description. (closes: #362070)
  * Add Galician debconf translation. (closes: #361258)
  * Update Danish debconf translation. (closes: #357969)
  * Use 'reload' during logrotate instead of 'restart'. It looks safe
    on CUPS 1.2. (though job-restart problem still remains)
  * set TZ in init script only if TZ isn't defined yet.
  * Use if-fi structure style for postrotate of logrotate script.
    It solves error when cupsys is not running. (closes: #347641)
  * Unset TMPDIR environment variable before running daemon. (closes: #347829)
  * Removed /etc/cups/pdftops.conf because it was for pdftops of upstream
    version. Debian CUPS uses xpdf-utils wrapper and doesn't need
    pdftops.conf.
  * Notice: /etc/cups/client.conf has been removed upstream.
  * Notice: {dis,en}able have been renamed to cups{dis,en}able.

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * debian/patches/48_stdlib.dpatch: Adapted to new upstream version.
  * debian/cupsys.init.d:
    - Fix arguments of start-stop-daemon and remove the hideous kill
      algorithm.
    - Ensure that /var/run/cupsd exists; this makes the init script work with
      /var/run mounted on a tmpfs.
  * debian/libcupsys2-dev.files, debian/libcupsimage2-dev.files: Remove static
    library; upstream does not build them any more, and they are useless
    anyway.
  * Add debian/patches/06_disable_backend_setuid.dpatch: Remove the uid
    changing in scheduler/cups-deviced.c which was introduced recently in
    upstream. It totally breaks device node access (e. g. /dev/lp0 is root:lp
    0660, which is inaccessible for a process which runs as lp:root).
  * debian/rules: Remove --with-cups-user, upstream does not support
    it any more.
  * debian/patches/09_runasuser_fixes.dpatch: RunAsUser was removed upstream;
    rename the patch to 09_runasuser.dpatch and rewrite it:
    - Enclose all changes in an #if CUPS_DROP_PRIVILEGES, so that it is easy to
      enable this feature.
    - scheduler/main.c: Drop privileges after initialization.
    - scheduler/conf.c: If we build with CUPS_DROP_PRIVILEGES, set RunUser to
      User instead of getuid(), since at that point we will always run as root
      (privileges cannot yet be dropped at that point).
    - config-scripts/cups-defaults.m4: Add --enable-privilege-dropping option.
    - config.h.in: Add CUPS_DROP_PRIVILEGES option template.
  * Add debian/patches/09_runasuser_autoconf.dpatch: autoconf changes for
    09_runasuser_fixes.dpatch changes.
  * debian/pdftops: Fix reading from stdin (https://launchpad.net/bugs/17124)
  * debian/cupsys.preinst: Remove dangling /etc/cups/pdftops.conf symlink on
    upgrades to unbreak printing with poppler-utils.
  * debian/control: Add poppler-utils alternative for xpdf-utils dependency.
  * Add debian/patches/12_quiesce_ipp_logging.dpatch:
    - Drop successful IPP messages to log level 'debug' and unsuccessful ones
      to 'info'.
    - Do not flood access_log with successful CUPS-Get-Printers and
      Get-Printer-Attributes queries (which are generated by e. g.
      gnome-cups-icon every 3 seconds).
    - Closes: #280718
  * Add debian/patches/13_default_log_warn.dpatch: Raise default log severity
    to 'warning' to not log gazillions of IPP requests by default. (other part
    of #280718)
  * debian/rules, debian/cupsys.postinst: Remove obsolete /etc/cups/certs and
    /var/lib/cups/certs (certificates are managed in /var/run/certs now).
  * debian/cupsys.preinst: Remove obsolete /etc/cups/certs symlink on upgrades.
  * debian/cupsys-client.files: Install cupstestdsc and manpage.
  * debian/cupsd.init: Have force-reload to reload, not restart.
  * debian/cupsys.logrotate: Use force-reload instead of reload, since the
    latter is not required to exist by Debian Policy.
  * debian/rules: Ship browsing_status and enable_browsing.
  * debian/patches/20_httpGetHostname_crash.dpatch: Add some robustifications
    to httpGetHostname() to hopefully fix a reported crash.

  * Updated Russian debconf translation, taken from cupsys trunk.
  * Downgrade port and browse question to low.
  * Add timeout routine to avoid lockup.
  * debian/patches/08_cupsd.conf.conf.d.dpatch:
    - Commented out Port/Listen/Browsing from cupsd.conf.in.
      CUPS crashes when there is a duplicate definition.
  * Updated Swedish debconf translation.
  * Set seen false flag when ports configuration is failed.
  * Allow '*' for hostname in ports.conf.
  * Use /bin/echo instead of shell built-in echo.
  * Improve cupsys.templates.
  * Updated Russian, German, Czech,French, Vietnamese debconf translation.
  * Removed example descriptions from init.d script.
  * Fix IPv4 validation.

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * Adapt debian/patches/02_configure.dpatch to r4885.
  * Move forcefully killing of cupsd if start-stop-daemon fails from
    postinst to init script, where it belongs to. Do not kill all running
    cupsd processes, but only the one in the pid file; this will unbreak cupsd
    behaviour in chroots.
  * debian/cupsys.default: Remove obsolete FORCE_RESTART option.
  * Resurrect debian/patches/01_cupsimage.dpatch (formerly
    03_cupsimage.dpatch), as we get unresolved symbols if libcupsimage
    isn't properly linked to libcupsys, causing other packages to FTBFS.
    Thanks to Adam Conrad.
  * debian/cupsys.init.d: Add --oknodo to not fail if cupsd is already
    running.
  * debian/rules: In clean rule, clean up a lot of files that are left behind
    by 'make clean'.

cupsys (1.1.99.b1.r4876-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * debian/local/{enable_browsing,browsing_status}: Adapt configuration file
    locations to new conf.d structure.
  * debian/cupsys.templates: Fix default value for cupsys/browse: 'yes' is an
    invalid bool option, change to true.
  * debian/cupsys.init.d: Use LSB init functions. Add lsb-base package
    dependency.
  * debian/cupsys.postinst: Wait a second between kill -9'ing cupsys and
    checking if the process still exists to avoid false positives and upgrade
    failures.
  * Clean up support for /etc/cups/conf.d:
    - Add debian/patches/08_cupsd.conf.conf.d.dpatch: Add include commands to
      default cupsd.conf file.
    - debian/cupsys.postinst: Remove fiddling with cupsd.conf.
    - This will ensure that cupsd.conf will remain an unchanged conffile.
  * debian/rules: Remove empty debian/patched on clean.
  * debian/patches/10_cupsd.conf2.dpatch: Re-enable listening to localhost to
    make the web interface work.
  * debian/patches/44_fixconfdirperms.dpatch:
    - Put configuration files into group root instead of nobody to avoid
      privilege escalation of nobody/nogroup and comply to Debian standards.
    - Use CUPS_DEFAULT_GROUP instead of 'nobody' as the default group for
      setgid'ing to and conffiles which must be writable for cupsd.
    - Disable changing permissions of cupsd.conf conffile.
  * Add debian/patches/09_runasuser_fixes.dpatch:
    - scheduler/main.c: Generate a certificate even when running as user, just
      as in 1.1.x; this unbreaks local certificate authorization for cupsd
      when it runs as normal user.
    - scheduler/main.c: When running as non-root, call initgroups() instead of
      setgroups() to allow auxiliary groups. These are required to access
      different device types (lp for USB/parallel printers, dialout for serial
      printers, etc.)

cupsys (1.1.22-6) unstable; urgency=high

  * Replaced upstream pdftops (derived from Xpdf) with pdftops.pl wrapper.
    pdftops.pl is made by Helge Blischke, GNU GPL licensed.

    CUPS 1.1.22 should enter to Sarge ASAP by some security reasons,
    but upstream pdftops prevents to enter because it has libgcc_s.so
    dependency and current gcc 3.4 faces difficult 'unwind' problem.
    Now I believe cupsys 1.1.22-6 can enter soon without waiting
    gcc problem.

    If you want to print PDF files directly, you need to install
    xpdf-utils. pdftops.pl calls pdftops in xpdf-utils package.
  * Fix typo in control file.

cupsys (1.1.22-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release for unstable. Time is over, sarge isn't shipped.
    I checked 1.1.21 to 1.1.22 migration doesn't break ABI quickly,
    but I'm still scared...
  * Apply gcc-4.0 patch for amd64: 37gfxfont.patch (closes: #285601)
  * Do 'restart' instead of 'reload' when log is rotated.
    'reload' sometime causes just shutdown daemon. (Unknown problem)
  * Fix equation in cupsys.postscript. (closes: #285205)
  * Apply Russell's patch: 38httpwait.patch (closes: #284829)
    (This is trial. If there is any grave problem by this, I'll off this
     patch)
    - Made http_wait() handle EINTR.  This bug was causing cups
      to print multiple copies of reports on remote printers.
    - Lengthed the wait in ipp_http_read to handle connections
      running over the internet.  The short wait was causing
      unwated multiple copies of reports to be printed.
    - While both these bugs need to be fixed, neither completely
      solves the original multiple copies problem.  To solve
      that no data should be printed if there was a read error.
  * Add dependency version of smbclient. (closes: #284733)
  * Fix SIGSEGV when remote destination goes timeout: 39remotetimeout.patch

cupsys (1.1.20candidate6-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add French translation (closes: Bug#220805). Thanks, Christian.
  * openssl, popular SSL implementation, becomes Debian main, so I think
    it is no reason for using libgnutls. I changed depends openssl instead of
    libgnutls.

cupsys (1.1.19final-2) unstable; urgency=low

    Closes: #189795.
  * Added a dh_makeshlibs call for libcupsimage2.
  * Made libcupsys2 conflict with cupsys-driver-gimpprint versions
    built before the libcupsimage split.  Closes: #189175.
  * Move /etc/printcap.cups to /var/run/cups/printcap, since it's
    generated and non-editable.  Also, take care of the /etc/printcap
    symlink.  Closes: #187954.
  * Per suggestion from the KDE project, suggest the kdeprint package
    instead of the kdelibs3-cups package.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Sat, 10 May 2003 13:05:33 -0500

cupsys (1.1.19candidate1-3) unstable; urgency=low

    libcupsimage split.  This is part of the fix for bug 189175.

    the right package versions.  Closes: #174391.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Tue, 22 Apr 2003 14:27:43 -0500

cupsys (1.1.19candidate1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.  I will try to follow upstream's new
    release policy by uploading release candidate versions to 
    unstable.
  * Wrote a new GNU TLS patch, which was accepted by upstream.
    Re-enable SSL support based on this.
  * Based on recent upstream work, wrote a libpaper patch which has
    also been accepted upstream.  Closes: #60035, #88597, #101591.
  * Upstream fix included to allow SLP-only browsing support to work.
    Closes: #178380.
  * Updated the Spanish debconf template for cupsys-bsd.
    Closes: #167171.
  * Added cupstestppd to cupsys-client.  Closes: #176941.
  * Don't respect TMPDIR if we don't have write permissions to that
    directory.  Closes: #176725.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Sat, 12 Apr 2003 14:36:20 -0500

cupsys (1.1.18-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Split libcupsimage into its own package.  Closes: #187897.
  * Added versioned build-dep on debhelper >= 2.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Tue,  8 Apr 2003 02:59:57 -0500

cupsys (1.1.18-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Disable SSL again.  Inexplicably, the GNU TLS people put the
    OpenSSL compatibility layer under the GPL, not the LGPL.
    This forces the effective license on libcupsys2 to GPL, which
    I'm not comfortable with.  The urgency reflects possible
    license conflicts for apps that link to libcupsys2.
    Closes: #168056.
  * Add a debconf question to ask whether unrecognized
    application/octet-stream jobs should be printed as raw jobs.
  * Forward-port some of the security fixes from woody.
  * Set the default group for lppasswd to "lpadmin", in keeping
    with the default in cupsd.  Closes: #172842.
  * Replaced the conflict with manpages-fr, versioned this time
    to allow for easy upgrades.  Also added a Replaces entry for
    it.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Sun,  5 Jan 2003 23:36:50 -0500

cupsys (1.1.18-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream version.  This is a security update for problems that
    include remote root exploits - thus the urgency.
  * Remove the conflict with manpages-fr per reports that the offending
    files are now all gone.  Closes: #158500.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Fri, 20 Dec 2002 03:27:18 -0500

cupsys (1.1.16-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Documentation updates.
  * Change the GNU TLS patch to more explicitly control which SSL
    library is linked to, and support switching SSL libraries in
    the build.  By default, the package will not use OpenSSL, so
    autobuilders won't accidentally build it that way.
    Closes: #167489.
  * Add libgnutls-dev to the Dependencies for libcupsys2-dev.
  * Set the proper permissions on cupsys-client man pages.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Sat,  9 Nov 2002 16:39:54 -0500

cupsys (1.1.16-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Totally nuke all script modifications for dh_installinit; do it
    all manually instead.  Closes: #166878.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Tue, 29 Oct 2002 23:06:20 -0500

cupsys (1.1.16-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add libpam-dev to Build-Depends.  Closes: #166556.
  * Update clean target in debian/rules to clean a few more files
    that are missed by the Makefiles.
  * Remove SFont.cxx and T1Font.cxx from the pdftops Makefile;
    these two files aren't needed, and including them would pull
    in a build dep on xlibs-dev, which is bad news.  Closes: #166716.
  * Tell dh_installdocs to not mess with the postinst/prerm, so
    the compatibility symlinks aren't created.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Tue, 29 Oct 2002 00:45:38 -0500

cupsys (1.1.16-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version...  Closes: #165631.
  * ...which includes bugfixes to several BSD utilities to avoid
    segfaulting when certain options are misused.  Closes: #159597.
  * Add upstream patch to scheduler that fixes certain printer
    operations in the web interface.
  * Re-enabled SSL support using the OpenSSL compatibility library
    in libgnutls.  Closes: #150600.
  * Use our own logic for stopping/restarting cupsd on upgrade,
    instead of relying on dh_installinit.  Closes: #160345, #164435.
  * Make cupsys-client Recommend cupsys-bsd.  Closes: #157974.
  * Make sure we remove everything in /var/spool/cups on purge.
    Closes: #163571.
  * Make force-reload send SIGHUP, since policy prefers that mode
    of operation.
  * Add dependencies for libcupsys2-dev on the image libraries we
    need.  Closes: #166451.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Sat, 26 Oct 2002 19:37:56 -0500

cupsys (1.1.15-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix segfault in lp when passing "-q" by itself as the last
    option.  Closes: #150819.
  * Make the switch to libpng3, now that woody is out.
    Closes: #156622.
  * It seemed that the rastertoepson filter occasionally lost its
    cookies under certain circumstances and passed NULL for a field.
    Cancel the pending job if that happens.  Closes: #147119.
  * Remove .cvsignore files.
  * Turned browsing back on by default.  With no BrowseAddresses set,
    no broadcast packets will go out, but cupsd will recognize and
    accept incoming packets.  Closes: #155574.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Tue, 20 Aug 2002 15:51:45 -0500

cupsys (1.1.15-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Reorganized the French man pages so they appear in the proper
    packages.
  * Declared a Conflict between cupsys-bsd and manpages-fr, as the
    latter package includes man pages for lpr, lpq, and lprm.
  * Move lpinfo and lpmove utilities to cupsys-client, where they
    belong.
  * Added patch from upstream that fixes some problems with
    Orientation settings made by some PostScript generators.
    Closes: #155534.
  * Fixed compiler settings for the static and shared versions of
    libcupsys2.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Sun, 11 Aug 2002 02:45:02 -0500

  * Removed SSL support again due to license infection problems.
    Closes: #154792.
  * Removed the preformatted French man pages.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Mon, 29 Jul 2002 19:02:21 -0500

cupsys (1.1.15-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Removed cupsys-pstoraster (since it's no longer provided in CUPS),
    and rely on gs-esp instead for its functionality.
  * Enabled SSL support and updated copyright file to reflect license
    change.  Closes: #150600.
  * Applied patch from upstream that causes the cupsd foreground
    process to wait until the daemon is ready before exiting.
    Also, changed init script to wait on the daemon before continuing.
    Closes: #150426.
  * Moved /etc/cups/certs to /var/spool/cups/certs.  Closes: #144887.
  * Split out German and Portugese debconf templates into separate
    files, and added French, Russian, and Spanish files.
    Closes: #137630, #138068, #142904.
  * Make cupsys Recommend smbclient, and handle symlinking smbspool
    to /usr/lib/cups/backend/smb if it's available.  Closes: #82690.
  * Make cupsys Suggest foomatic-bin for cupsomatic, so that
    linuxprinting.org PPDs work.  Closes: #146655.
  * Add examples/filters directory to cupsys and added the contributed
    DVI filter to it.  Users can copy the filter and config files into
    place themselves to get the functionality.  Closes: #55013, #136496.
  * Fixed a bug where "-" filters are rejected in some cases.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Mon, 29 Jul 2002 00:33:00 -0500

cupsys (1.1.14-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed libpng dependency to "libpng2 | libpng" to accomodate the
    current libpng policy.
  * Changed adduser dep so that the proper adduser (that does root) is
    available for the postinst.  Closes: #133709.
  * Removed spaces from init script output.  Closes: #133262.
  * Set TZ in init script to REALLY fix timezone problem.  
    Closes: #130676.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Sat,  9 Mar 2002 23:48:41 -0500

cupsys (1.1.14-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Remove all the stuff about setting the lpd backend setuid; per
    upstream, we don't need it anymore, and it's a security hole.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Sun, 17 Feb 2002 18:52:45 -0500

cupsys (1.1.14-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream version.
  * Fixes more buffer overflows not covered in the previous patch;
    thus the urgency.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Wed, 13 Feb 2002 22:40:50 -0500

cupsys (1.1.13-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fix potentially exploitable buffer overflow in cups/ipp.c.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Sat,  9 Feb 2002 21:27:41 -0500

cupsys (1.1.13-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Silly me.  fopen() returns NULL, not non-NULL, when it fails. :-)
    Closes: #130532, #131433.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Sat,  2 Feb 2002 16:10:20 -0500

cupsys (1.1.12-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix man page references so, e.g., references go from backend(1) to
    cups-backend(1).  Closes: #126811.
  * Oops!  Debian has time_t->tm_gmtoff, which is defined to have the
    opposite sign of timezone.  Is it that way on BSD?  Anyway,
    reverse the sense of the sign for time_t->tm_gmtoff if we use
    that.  Closes: #126195.
  * Add header for gs_malloc to pstoraster/gscrdp.c, to prevent
    problems with implicit declaration on 64-bit systems.
    Closes: #126002.
  * cgi-bin/admin.c: Be a little bit more paranoid about one's ability
    to write to tempfiles.  Closes: #122324.
  * Enabled OpenSLP support.
  * Cleaned up Priorities and Sections.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Sun, 20 Jan 2002 02:14:35 -0500

cupsys (1.1.12-4) unstable; urgency=low

    Closes: #123280.
  * Minor change to the init script output.  Closes: #121938.
  * Changed choose-uri.tmpl to be a little more clear.
    Closes: #117376.
  * Moved CUPS document root from /usr/share/doc/cupsys to
    /usr/share/cups/doc-root, and created a symlink from
    /u/s/d/cupsys/online-docs to it.  It turns out that serving
    files via CUPS from /usr/share/doc is a policy violation.
    Closes: #120923.
  * Fixed a small problem when upgrading from potato libcupsys1-dev
    to current libcupsys2-dev.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Mon, 17 Dec 2001 00:58:41 -0500

cupsys (1.1.12-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix libcupsys2 shlibs file to provide the proper dependency
    information.  Closes: #121405.
  * Oops!  Make sure SSL support isn't built yet.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Wed, 28 Nov 2001 11:41:17 -0500

cupsys (1.1.12-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * It helps to run autoconf after making a change to the configure
    script. :-)  CXX=$CC change wasn't propagated, making the build
    fail on hppa.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Mon, 26 Nov 2001 12:01:58 -0500

cupsys (1.1.12-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.  Closes: #119162.
  * Updated Standards-Version.
  * Made cupsys depend on debconf.
  * Removed -Wl,rpath from config-scripts/cups-sharedlibs.m4.
  * Removed explicit libcupsys dep from cupsys.
  * Removed "CXX=$CC" from config-scripts/cups-compiler.m4.
  * Removed .SILENT from Makedefs so the build isn't silent anymore.
  * On devfs, look in /dev/printers as well as /dev/parallel.
    (Do we still need /dev/parallel?)  Closes: #114063.
  * Changed internal file: device URI type to test:, since (per
    upstream) it's not intended for anything other than to test
    filters.  See bug #115252 or README.Debian for more info.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Sun, 25 Nov 2001 11:21:32 -0500

cupsys (1.1.10-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Switched cupsenable and cupsdisable symlinks to always point to
    /usr/sbin/accept to prevent them from breaking when files move
    around (as they did recently).  Closes: #114006.
  * It turns out that libcupsys needs to make temp files in
    /var/spool/cups/tmp, so that dir needs to be in the package.
    Closes: #115154.
  * Related to the above, when creating temp files, don't loop when
    the open fails unless the return value is EEXIST.  Thanks to Brian
    Ristuccia for the suggestion.
  * Honor the DEB_BUILD_OPTTIONS "debug" setting.
  * Per policy, make sure we build with -D_REENTRANT.
  * Don't remove /var/spool/cups in the cupsys postrm when purging.
  * Added German description to template.  Closes: #113604.
  * Added Portuguese description to cupsys-bsd template.  
    Closes: #106131.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Thu, 18 Oct 2001 23:07:34 -0500

cupsys (1.1.10-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Scale back a bit on aggressiveness on purging cupsys, as it can
    cause us to remove the cupsys-client conffile.
  * It turns out that client.conf is parsed by libcupsys2, not
    cupsys-client, so it needs to switch packages.
  * Changed PAM code so it attempts to open the "cupsys" PAM config
    file, instead of the "cups" one.  Not sure how this broke again.
    Closes: #110651.
  * Per request, implemented the "reload" option in the init script.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Wed, 19 Sep 2001 21:53:48 -0500

cupsys (1.1.10-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added Conflicts: on cupsys-pstoraster with older cupsys packages
    because of moved files.  Closes: #106107.
  * Fixed bug concerning update-inetd handling; it was removing the
    inetd entry for the lpd server in cupsys-bsd with every upgrade.
    Closes: #109298.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Thu, 30 Aug 2001 23:14:08 -0500

cupsys (1.1.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version - with Makefile oops fixed (1.1.10-1
    upstream).
  * Fixed lpadmin group creation so NIS-style lpadmin group is
    recognized.  Closes: #78895, #107744.
  * Replaced kups with kdelibs3-cups in Suggests: lines, and
    reorganized Suggests line.  Closes: #109695.
  * Moved Suggests for all add-on clients to cupsys-client.
  * Fixed purge so /etc/cups is completely cleaned out.
    Closes: #108488.
  * Moved filter and backend man pages to cups-filter and
    cups-backend to avoid conflicts with other packages.
    Closes: #107629.
  * Made the lpd backend non-setuid, and created a low-priority
    debconf question to handle the few who really need it setuid.
    Closes: #77617.
  * Altered cupsys-bsd postinst; always remove any inetd lines when
    removing the package (we'll put it back later if we're just
    upgrading).

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Tue, 28 Aug 2001 00:43:36 -0500

cupsys (1.1.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed PAM module name confusion (closes bugs #76457, #77114).
  * Fixed broken deps w.r.t. cupsys-client Replacing older cupsys
    versions (closes bug #75241).

    instead of the libcupsys2 package (closes bug #78485).

    start-stop-daemon, causing the prerm to fail if cupsd wasn't running
    (closes bug #70698).

cupsys (1.1.4-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fix misconfiguration in default config; cupsd now refuses connections
    to printers and printer classes from all hosts except localhost by
    default.  The previous default was to allow all hosts to connect to
    all printers - not a terribly secure default. :-)

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Sat, 18 Nov 2000 00:55:48 -0500

cupsys (1.0.4-8) stable; urgency=high

  * Security fix: the default configuration now no longer allows people
    to connect to printers except from localhost.  The previous default
    configuration allowed anyone to connect to any printer from any
    location; not a smart security move.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Sat, 18 Nov 2000 00:37:06 -0500

cupsys (1.1.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.

cupsys (1.1.0-0b3d1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Daemon 'cups-lpd' (new to this version) added to cupsys-bsd, with
    appropriate update-inetd calls, so cupsys-bsd is now a complete
    replacement for lpr.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Sun, 14 May 2000 00:08:23 -0500

cupsys (1.0.4-7) frozen unstable; urgency=high

  * Additional DoS fixes, included in Easy Software Products' patch for
    the bug below.  As these are DoS bugs, I HIGHLY recommend including
    this in potato.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Sun, 18 Jun 2000 22:39:01 -0500

cupsys (1.0.4-6) frozen unstable; urgency=high

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Tue, 13 Jun 2000 22:04:40 -0500

cupsys (1.0.4-5) frozen unstable; urgency=low

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Thu, 13 Apr 2000 23:09:40 -0500

cupsys (1.0.4-4) frozen unstable; urgency=low

    this.  Closes bug #60455 (severity: important).

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Wed, 15 Mar 2000 12:34:20 -0600

cupsys (1.0.4-3) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Oops - ppd directory move fails in preinst if /var/lib/cups/ppd is
    empty.  Reported as bug #59993, fixed.
  * Missed the library Build-Depends.  Closes bug #60090.
  * Postrm during purge now removes /etc/cups properly.
  * Documentation updates.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Fri, 10 Mar 2000 22:59:07 -0600

cupsys (1.0.4-2) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved /var/lib/cups/ppd/* config files (printer definitions) to
    /etc/cups/ppd (closes bug #59263).
  * Fixed shlibs for libcupsys1 (erroneous information) preventing
    packages that link to it from depending properly.
  * Changed default for browsing to Off to keep cupsd from probing the
    local network continuously (closes bug #59277).

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Sat,  4 Mar 2000 18:23:01 -0600

cupsys (1.0.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added quick hack to allow for -h option to lp (closes bug #52050).
  * Set the lpd backend suid after quick audit; it doesn't appear to have
    any egregious errors (closes part of bug #52381).
  * Move /var/lib/cups/conf files to /etc/cups, with a symlink in place of
    the old location (closes bug #52318).
  * Added "Authentication failed" message when authorizing after the first
    auth failure (which is likely before the first password request)
    (closes rest of bug #50264).

    section 6.6 (closes bug #51958).

cupsys (1.0.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Conflict with lprng, since lprng includes some SysV printing commands
    (closes bug #50539).
  * Added "cupsenable", "cupsdisable", "cupsaccept", and "cupsreject"
    commands as part of an ongoing effort to reduce namespace pollution.
    (addresses part of bug #50661 and #50384)
  * Set both the default user and group to "lp" (for permissions fixes).
  * Created "lpadmin" group and set SystemGroup to this.  This will
    fix problems with CUPS not being usable initially.  As soon as
    bug #50620 gets fixed, I'll set up to add root to the group, which
    will make root able to configure CUPS immediately after installation.

cupsys (1.0.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed wrong symlinks. (closes bug #50279)

    the links in the HTML, and generally caused confusion. (closes
    part of bug #50264)

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Mon, 15 Nov 1999 22:28:56 -0600

cupsys (1.0.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * cupsys-bsd should conflict with lpr, not "lpd" (whatever that is) 
  (closes #50047)
  
  * Changed priority to "extra".

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Fri, 12 Nov 1999 22:24:15 -0600
