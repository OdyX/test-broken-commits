_Description: Do you want to set up the BSD lpd compatibility server?
 This package contains a server that can accept BSD-style print jobs and
 submit them to CUPS. It should only be set up if you have other computers
 that submit jobs over the network via "BSD" or "LPR" services, and these
 computers cannot be converted to use the IPP protocol that CUPS uses.
