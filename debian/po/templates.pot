"This package contains a server that can accept BSD-style print jobs and "
"submit them to CUPS. It should only be set up if you have other computers "
"that submit jobs over the network via \"BSD\" or \"LPR\" services, and these "
"computers cannot be converted to use the IPP protocol that CUPS uses."

msgstr ""

#. Type: boolean
#. Description
#: ../cupsys.templates:4
msgid ""
"All print jobs in IPP get a MIME type. Since not all sources of print jobs "
"can attach an appropriate type, many jobs get submitted as the MIME type "
"application/octet-stream. Because of this, when CUPS receives a job with "
"that MIME type, it attempts to guess what the format is. By default, if it "
"cannot guess the proper type, it rejects the job."
msgstr ""

#. Type: boolean
#. Description
#: ../cupsys.templates:4
msgid ""
"It is possible to cause CUPS to treat all unrecognized jobs with this MIME "
"type as \"raw\" jobs, which causes them to be sent directly to the printer "
"without processing."
msgstr ""

#. Type: boolean
#. Description
#: ../cupsys.templates:4
msgid ""
"If you will be accepting print jobs from Windows computers, you probably "
"want this option set, as Windows gives all IPP print jobs processed by a "
"local driver the MIME type application/octet-stream. Samba also submits its "
"print jobs this way."
